                No one really knows. Some say he's just a Teenager with a Personal Computer and too much Time. 
                Others say he's an AI Prodigy and the last level of Prompt Engineering, still can't interpret it 
                about who is he. He completed all the levels in Backrooms and is back to the reality because he 
                was getting too boring. What we do know is this: whatever he builds, builds for fun somehow ends 
                up better than the "serious" stuff that corporations sweat over (sorry YouTube, sorry Amazon‚Äîyour 
                UI needs a nap). ~[+‚àû Aura]

                He began his so-called "career" in June 2025‚Äîwhich basically means he stopped pretending school 
                made sense. College? Might not make it past 2026. Why? Because dreams don't wait, and this guy's 
                chasing his income goals like they owe him money. Will leave college as soon as the project starts 
                getting moneti~ Shhh~ Let's not tell anyone my 69th secret.

                Samrat's brain is a cluttered museum of almost everything from ancient societies (half the world, 
                okay‚Äîmaybe except Africa, long story... <span className="line-through text-gray-500">racist issues</span>) 
                to philosophy and quantum chaos. He knows a little about almost everything‚Äîexcept maybe what he's 
                actually supposed to be doing with his life.

                One minute he's coding, the next he's learning the history of socks, and then somehow building a 
                website with soul. Confused? So is he. That's part of the charm.
